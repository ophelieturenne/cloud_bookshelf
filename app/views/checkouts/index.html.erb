<!-- This view displays a list of the user's checkouts. -->
<!--
- The header "My Checkouts" is displayed at the top.
- If there are checkouts (`@checkouts`), they are displayed in a styled table with:
  - Columns for the book title, library name, start date, due date, status, and actions.
  - Links for each book and library lead to their respective show pages.
  - The "Status" column displays "Overdue" in red if the `due_date` has passed and "On Time" in green otherwise.
  - The "Actions" column includes a button to mark the book as returned, which sends a `PATCH` request to the `return_checkout_path`.
- If no checkouts exist, a message "No checkouts found." is displayed.
